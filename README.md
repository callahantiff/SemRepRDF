# SemRepRDF
This repository contains code used to transform the National Library of Medicineâ€™s Semantic Representation (SemRep) predications into open semantically-linked annotations. Please see the Wiki for more details.


## Getting Started

To obtain an RDFized version of SemRep, download the zip file or fork the project repository. Additional instructions can be found under [*Installation*](Installation).


### Installation

This program was written on a system running OS X Sierra. Successful execution of this program requires Python version 2.7.

  * Python 2.7.13 modules
    * Native Modules: base64, hashlib, multiprocessing, MySQLdb, os, sys
    * To download needed modules run the following from the working directory of the project folder:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  * Semantic MEDLINE Database
    * If using SemRepRDF-UMLS you will need to obtain a free [UMLS license](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/)
    * Download and configure the latest SemMedDB MySQL data dump [SemMedDB](https://skr3.nlm.nih.gov/SemMedDB/dbinfo.html)

  * Although not a requirement, the program has been written to run in parallel on a super computer.


## Running Program

The program can be run from the command line via argparse arguments.

```
# from project directory - find help menu
tiffanycallahan$ python RDFizer.py -h



# to run the program
tiffanycallahan$ python RDFizer.py

```

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.

## Testing
We are in the process of developing tests for each module. We will create documentation as they are created.

## License
The SemRep (Database Version 3.0_A; SemRep Version 1.7; Date 12/31/2016) is the original source of the predications. Neither the United States Government, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, the National Library of Medicine, the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, nor any of their agencies, contractors, subcontractors, or employees make any warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to the SKR resources, and furthermore, they assume no liability for any party's use, or the results of such use, of any part of these tools.  

This repository generates two different kinds of output that are subject to two different kind of licensing (see details regarding these representations on the [Wiki](https://github.com/callahantiff/SemRepRDF/wiki/Licensing)):
  1. The SemRep representation uses concepts that are part of the UMLS Metathesaurus and are thus subject to the [UMLS license agreement](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/license.html).
  2. The open SemRepRDF version has been generated in such a way that all annotated concept identifiers come only from terminologies, vocabularies, and ontologies with open license agreements. <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/80x15.png" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>. Minor modifications to the original SemRep predications include the mapping of UMLS CUIs to open resource concept identifiers.
